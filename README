repo for programming assignment

input files must include the outer wall, and the outer wall must be solid

Input File Definition:
The first line is the total size of the cave in (w h), this size includes the 
outer wall. the next lines define the cave itself. These lines should match the
dimensions defined in line 1 (i.e. if the first line is '4 3', then the next 3
lines should each have 4 characters.
character definitions:
# - Wall
W - Wumpus
P - Pit
G - Gold
any other character will result in an empty space

the line directly after the cave definition contains the coordinates of the 
supmuw (x y), and the line directly after that defines the starting point of 
the agent. 
Remember when placing these that there is the outer wall to 
account for (if either x or y are 0, then you're probably wrong)
******
coordinates start at the top left (like graphics coordinates)
******

ASSUMPTIONS:
arrows will travel until they hit something (wall, wumpus, supmuw)
the supmuw can only be heard in adjacent squares (orthogonally)
if the supmuw dies, it stops mooing
if the wumpus dies, it will still be smelled
the death scream of the wumpus and supmuw are different
a dead creature can only be seen if you are in its square
the supmuw is the only thing that can share a space with something else


1, 1 is actually the top left of the board

PRINTING:
on each move the agent makes, 2 images will display.
the pretty colored one is the actual board state
and the other one is the agent's 'knowledge'

Board state key:
A:agent
#:wall
S:supmuw
W:wumpus
o (blue background):pit
*:gold
$:dead supmuw
X:dead wumpus
% (red): supmuw and wumpus
% (green): supmuw and dead wumpus
@: supmuw in pit

empty squares may also be colored based on the agent's logic.
yellow squares are places that the agent has been
magenta squares are places where the agent plans to visit
    sometimes these magenta squares go away, that means the 
    agent couldn't find a suitable path at this moment

knowledge state key:
A: agent
?: it is not known for certain what is in this space
S: heard the moo of a wumpus
~: felt a breeze
*: saw glitter
#: bumped into wall
W: smelled wumpus
$: killed a wumpus here
X: killed a supmuw here
