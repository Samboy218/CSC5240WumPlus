repo for programming assignment

input files must include the outer wall, and the outer wall must be solid

Input File Definition:
The first line is the total size of the cave in (w h), this size includes the 
outer wall. the next lines define the cave itself. These lines should match the
dimensions defined in line 1 (i.e. if the first line is '4 3', then the next 3
lines should each have 4 characters.
character definitions:
# - Wall
W - Wumpus
P - Pit
G - Gold
any other character will result in an empty space

the line directly after the cave definition contains the coordinates of the 
supmuw (x y), and the line directly after that defines the starting point of 
the agent. 
Remember when placing these that there is the outer wall to 
account for (if either x or y are 0, then you're probably wrong)
******
coordinates start at the top left (like graphics coordinates)

ASSUMPTIONS:
arrows will travel until they hit something (wall, wumpus, supmuw)
the supmuw can only be heard in adjacent squares (orthogonally)
if the supmuw dies, it stops mooing
if the wumpus dies, it will still be smelled
the death scream of the wumpus and supmuw are different
a dead creature can only be seen if you are in its square


1, 1 is actually the top left of the board
